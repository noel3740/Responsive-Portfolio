                I'm Noel Nevarez. A web developer who loves to travel, cook and eat. I'm originally from Slidell Louisiana. 
                I'm not a big fan of the heat and with humidity frequently around 100%, Louisiana was not an ideal place. 
                I always wanted to live up north in a place that actually had seasons. I took a vacation to Chicago in 2007 and fell in love with the people and big city life.
                I decided I wanted to live in Chicago and months later I was living in the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've traveled all over the US including California, Nevada, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, 
                Arkansas, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
                New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Hawaii. 
                Internationally I've traveled to Puerto Rico, Mexico, Canada, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Greece, 
                England, Scotland, and Ireland. The top places I want to visit next are Japan, China, or any Asian country, 
                Australia, or New Zealand.
